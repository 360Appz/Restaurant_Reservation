## Technologies Used:
* HTML (Frontend)
* CSS (Frontend, Includes Bootswatch for typography)
* PHP (Backend, Used to push data from the form to database)
* MySql (As data is structured in nature, MySQL RDMS is enough)

* ### Reason for technology stack
On most front-end frameworks like angular,react native, or vue.js. HTML & CSS is commonly used for styling and presentation. In this case, PHP is used as the backend as it works well with MySql database system. Unless, other database such as MongoDb is required for unstructured data, the javascript will be a much better option as JSON works well javascript

2. List a few version control software available that is commonly used by developers.
 * Github
 * SVN
 * CVS
 * Mercurial
 * Monotone
